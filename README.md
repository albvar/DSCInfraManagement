# DSCInfraManagement
The goal of this repo is to help me and others navigate the intial scaffolding/implementation of DSC to manage the the lifecycle of assets in an windows server environment.
The main focus will be initial implementation and scaffolding to facilitate an implementation around DSC Composite resources using the least amount of infrastructure possible to deliver a POC. Initially my intent is to deliver a boostrap configuration using file shares, scheduled tasks delivered via GPO and the LCM client on each windows server 2012+ running powershell 5.1. Concerns around managing exceptions while also avoiding duplication is a top priority.
